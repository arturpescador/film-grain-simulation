# Film Grain Simulation

## Project Description

This project aims to implement two methods to simulate film grain in digital images. The first method is based on the Noise-Power Spectrum of the film grain, while the second one is based on a stochastic model of the film grain. The objective is to evaluate the quality of both methods.
